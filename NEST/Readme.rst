--------------------

This is the NEST implementation of the network model discussed in the paper. There are a few differences from the original model:

- The neurons are assigned (x, y) locations to make visualisation easier. This does not affect the simulation in any way. It is only used for visualisation.
- The stored patterns are circular in shape, instead of quadrilateral as in the original implementation

The :code:`scripts` directory contains shell scripts that you can use to run the model and generate the graphs. It is suggested that they be used as reference - they may need to be adapted to update file locations to reflect one's personal setup.
