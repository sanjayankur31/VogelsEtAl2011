--------------------

This is the NEST implementation of the network model discussed in the paper. There are a few differences from the original model:

- The neurons are assigned (x, y) locations to make visualisation easier. This does not affect the simulation in any way. It is only used for visualisation.
- The stored patterns are circular in shape, instead of quadrilateral as in the original implementation

The set of scripts at https://github.com/sanjayankur31/Sinha2016-scripts can be adapted to generate the required plots.
